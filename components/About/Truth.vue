      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900 leading-tight">
        Technology alone doesn’t<br />change an industry. People do!
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
        That’s why, at Logistic Journey, we don’t show up as <span class="font-semibold">“software providers.”</span><br />
        We show up as collaborators, guides, and thought partners for teams who want to deliver better — not just once, but every time.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 text-gray-700">
        We believe logistics shouldn’t feel like firefighting. It should feel like flow.<br />
        And we believe the people who get there first aren’t the ones with the biggest budgets...<br />
        They’re the ones who <span class="font-semibold">decide to lead.</span>

      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 flex items-start">
        <span class="mr-2 text-xl">👉</span>
        That’s what we do, every day — alongside businesses who are ready to lead.
