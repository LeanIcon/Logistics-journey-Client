    question: 'What is last–mile delivery?',
    answer:
      'Last-mile delivery is the final step of the logistics process — when goods move from a warehouse, depot, or hub to the customer’s final destination. It’s called the last mile because it’s the last (and often most complex) part of the delivery chain. This stage directly impacts customer satisfaction, delivery costs, and brand reputation — which is why optimising it is so critical.'
